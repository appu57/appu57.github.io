                    <li>This clip talks about the frameworks I have used to implement the E-commerce application</li>
                    <li>In addition to above,I have also added few points describing the functionality of authgaurds
                        that restricts the user from navigating to the home page without logging in into the application</li>
                        <a href="#">Top</a>

                <p>B. User LogIn/SignUp activities [0:30 - 0:52]</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> A brief description about user logIn/SignUp activity.To begin with, the user first registers
                        into the application using the signup page </li>
                    <li>A flash message is popped up if the registration is successful.Now the user enters the log in
                        page
                    </li>
                    <li>In log in page the user is supposed to enter the email and password he/she used while signing up
                        once the signup and login credentials matches ,authentication is successful token is generated
                        using jsonwebtoken
                        and is navigated to the home page. <a href="#">Top</a>

                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>C. Home Page [0:52 - 1:27]</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> To start with, here I have highlighted about the home page structure </li>
                    <li>It contains a image slider that attracts the user attention.It also includes the way 
                        products from model schema is organised in the home page.Displaying the products according to its
                        category[For eg.Fruits,Vegetables]</li>
                    <li>Buttons that are visible on the home page and its uses.Here, I have spoken about the cart button 
                        which navigates the user into the cart page and shows various product that would be added to cart by the user
                        <a href="#">Top</a>

                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="intro-container">
                <p>D. Facilities that my application provides for the user [1:28 - 2:36]</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> User can view the product , delete the product from cart , add the product to the cart,
                         view the order summary and confirm the order </li>
                    <li>Once the user views the product and wants to buy the oroduct he/she can add that product to cart by just
                        pressing on add to cart button .The user can add/delete product from the cart.
                    </li>
                    <li>In the cart page , the user can check all the products he/she has added and can also delete from the cart.In addition
                        user can also view order summary and confirm the order. 
                    </li>
                    <li>For the user,the "admin only" button is disabled and is enabled only for admin.Because by default
                         the admin row in the document collection for the user is set as false.
                         <a href="#">Top</a>
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <div class="intro-container">
                <p>E. Authorities that an admin can access from my application [2:36 - 4:50]</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> As explained previously, by default "admin" row in the document collections
                        is set as false for any sort of signup/login. The person whose login credentials matches with the
                        credentials saved in my config.js and the model is now termed as an admin.That is due to the "Admin" row
                         in the collection is automatically set to true when credentials matches.
                         </li>
                    <li>Here the admin can add new products , delete the existing product and edit the details of the existing product
                    </li>
                    <li> "Admin only" button is enabled now because the person currently using the application is an admin</li>
                    <li>Here for illustration I have added a new product that is "POMOGRANATE" to demonstrate the functionality</li>
                    <li>It also includes the updating of the existing product details, here I have updated the price and description</li>
                    <li>Admin can also delete the product and I have deleted the "Toor Dal"                          <a href="#">Top</a>
